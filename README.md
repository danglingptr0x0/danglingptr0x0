# Hey, people <img src="https://github.com/simonSlamka/simonSlamka/blob/834880a865bb9b629ecbd092282f6ec3f9afb45d/v.gif" width="80px">

#### I'm a student programmer who makes games. Since I was a child, I wanted to write stories and then somehow be able to show them to the world. I started writing e-books, but that wasn't satisfactory; something was missing: there was no way to interact with the story and change how it unfolds. So I got into game dev. A few years have passed, and I have incorporated my own company, and now I primarily make games, but my company also makes websites, provides tech support, builds desktops, and runs penetration tests for individuals.
