# Hey, people <img src="https://github.com/simonSlamka/simonSlamka/blob/834880a865bb9b629ecbd092282f6ec3f9afb45d/v.gif" width="80px">

### What I do

I'm a student programmer who, among else, makes games. Since I was a child, I wanted to write stories and then somehow be able to show them to the world. I started writing e-books, but that wasn't satisfactory; something was missing: there was no way to interact with the story and change how it unfolds. So I got into game dev. A few years have passed, and I have incorporated my own company, and now I primarily make games, but my company also makes websites, provides tech support, builds desktops, and runs penetration tests for enterprises.

### Something more about me

**I love stats.** For example, seeing a graph of my daily/weekly/yearly productivity or my long-term music listening history is feels exciting. It grants you a look to the depths of your life, potentially uncovering ways to improve and become more performant.
I use [Exist](exist.io) on a daily basis. The top thing about _Exist_ is that it aggregates data from many sources, so you can, over time, see correlations between data sources. For example, in my case, the less time I spend asleep, the more productive I seem to be ðŸ˜‚.
<br/>For my computer/phone usage, I use [RescueTime](rescuetime.com).
<br/>For coding tracking, I use [WakaTime](wakatime.com/simonSlamka).
